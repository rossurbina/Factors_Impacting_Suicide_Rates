# Factors_Impacting_Suicide_Rates
Correlation and Regression Analysis on Factors that Impact Suicide Rates

## Purpose
Suicides are a very complex and serious topic, and I wanted to examine which factors impact suicide rates. By understanding who is more likely to commit suicide through data based on factors, it can hopefully help to reduce the number of suicides. This analysis will look at the variation in social, economic, and political factors of each country in the United Nations to identify patterns that may explain variation in suicide rates around the world.

## Data Tools Used
I used Python in Jupyter Notebook to clean, transform, and analyze the data. Here is the link to the [Jupyter notebook file](https://github.com/rossurbina/Factors_Impacting_Suicide_Rates/blob/main/Factors_Impacting_Suicide_Rates.ipynb)
